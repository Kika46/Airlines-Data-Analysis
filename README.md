Flight Price Analysis Project
Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of flight booking options. The goal is to understand how various factors—such as airline carrier, days left before departure, and flight timing—influence ticket prices. The analysis compares Economy and Business class tickets and visualizes booking trends.

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas (Data cleaning & manipulation)

Seaborn & Matplotlib (Statistical data visualization)

Key Insights & Analysis
The notebook answers 9 key business questions, including:

Airline Frequency: Identified the most frequent carriers in the dataset.

Price vs. Airline: Analyzed average ticket prices across different airlines, segmented by Class (Economy vs. Business).

Timing Impact: Investigated how Departure and Arrival times affect pricing.

Booking Window: Visualized the correlation between "Days Left" and "Price" to understand last-minute booking surges.

Route Analysis: Examined price variations based on Source and Destination cities.

Specific Querying: Calculated specific metrics, such as the average price for Vistara business class flights from Delhi to Hyderabad.
